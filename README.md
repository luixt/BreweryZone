Submitted by: **Luis delgado**

This web app: **Web Interface that displays a list of brewery places in Florida**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [x] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [x] **Location**
  - [x] **Total number of displayed breweries**
  - [x] **Most common brewery type**
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [x] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [x] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

## Notes

It was quite challenging to deal with the filtering aspect of the project. It was rather difficult to discover an initial method to set up the filtering logic and code implementation without much practice or foundation. Thus, it was necessary to search for online documentation and support. Also, the main bugs and issues arised during the development of the filtering features. Regardless, at the end I managed to make the program work effectively through trial an error, trying to understand the concept and logic behind filtering techniques.
